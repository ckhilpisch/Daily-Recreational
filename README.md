## <div align="center"> Roadmap : </div>
For the future, there are a few ideas for app expansion:
*  An incorporation of more local events to include -  but not be limited to - state and local parks.   
* Along with more places a zip code radius to show the closest activities and return them in ascending order of proximity. 
* With all of the additional information, collpsable cards would be beneficial to hold more on the page.  
* An introduction of equipment rental and traveler tips that are specific to adventures offered at each location.  
* Eventually an expansion to an international app and an inclusion of more inspirational and entertaining quotes.
