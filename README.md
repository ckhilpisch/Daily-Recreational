The application can be run via the website page:

https://ckhilpisch.github.io/Daily-Recreational/  



## <div align="center"><a name="usage"> **Usage** :</a></div>
The user will come to the website, be able to chose an activity and a state, and see the parks that are located near them.  The park information returns a link to the website, a phone number, and a photo of the park.   This app also offers an inspirational quote to motivate and uplift the user.

One of the major requirements of any app is a responsive site.   Below are different sized versions.

## <div align="center"><a name="roadmap"> **Roadmap** :</a></div>
For the future, there are a few ideas for app expansion:
*  An incorporation of more local events to include -  but not be limited to - state and local parks.   
* Along with more places a zip code radius to show the closest activities and return them in ascending order of proximity. 
* With all of the additional information, collpsable cards would be beneficial to hold more on the page.  
* An introduction of equipment rental and traveler tips that are specific to adventures offered at each location.  
* Eventually an expansion to an international app and an inclusion of more inspirational and entertaining quotes.
